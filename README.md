# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux`

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

### `Create a file named src/app/store.js. Import the configureStore API from Redux Toolkit. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:`

app/store.js

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})

### `Provide the Redux Store to React`

Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux <Provider> around our application in src/index.js. Import the Redux store we just created, put a <Provider> around your <App>, and pass the store as a prop:

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import { store } from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

### `Create a Redux State Slice`

Add a new file named src/features/counter/counterSlice.js. In that file, import the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit.

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies. However, Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createReducer APIs use Immer inside to allow us to write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates.

features/counter/counterSlice.js

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer

### `Add Slice Reducers to the Store`

app/store.js

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
})

### `Use Redux State and Actions in React Components`


import React from 'react'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { decrement, increment } from './counterSlice'

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
